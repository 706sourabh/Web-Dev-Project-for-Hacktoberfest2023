Certainly! Here's a Python web application using the Flask framework with comments explaining each part:

1. First, make sure you have Flask installed by running `pip install Flask` if you haven't already.

2. Create a Python script for your web application (e.g., `app.py`):

```python
# Import Flask module
from flask import Flask

# Create an instance of the Flask class
app = Flask(__name__)

# Define a route for the root URL ('/')
@app.route('/')
def home():
    # This function will be called when someone visits the root URL
    return 'Hello, World! This is a simple Flask web application.'

# Run the Flask application if this script is executed
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

This code sets up a Flask web application with a single route, the root URL ('/'), and a view function called `home` that returns a "Hello, World!" message.

3. Save the code to a Python file (e.g., `app.py`).

4. To run the Flask application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see output indicating that your Flask app is running.

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000` to see your web application in action. You'll see the "Hello, World!" message.

This is a basic example, and Flask allows you to build more complex web applications by adding more routes, templates, connecting to databases, and enhancing the front-end with HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
